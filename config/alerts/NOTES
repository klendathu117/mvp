TODO
1. Easy next goal is to get sidebar buttons to load the correct view and implement back button (if its not a major lift)
2. Get some demo templates created and in the DB
3. Get the dropdown in Map Alerts to load from the list of custom templates
    - is that easier to call from the DB all unique names? whats best practice?
4. Get demo 3rd part alerts in that table, then have dropdown fetch list
5. begin exploring the mapping logic
    - field mappings highlight in green with numbers matching which fields to which on each json
